IMPORTANT NOTE FOR VIEWERS OF THE TUTORIAL:
This code has been updated from the original tutorial to work with newer versions of the libraries.
Changes made include:
1. Updated imports (langchain_chroma instead of langchain_community.vectorstores)
2. Updated embeddings (langchain_huggingface instead of OpenAI due to API limits)
3. Removed db.persist() call as it's no longer needed with newer Chroma versions
4. Added fallback mechanisms for when embeddings or LLM calls fail
5. Implemented a rule-based response generation instead of using OpenAI's API
6. Lowered relevance threshold from 0.7 to 0.4 to include more results
7. Added NLTK resource downloads (punkt, averaged_perceptron_tagger)
8. Fixed compatibility issues with newer versions of dependencies

Additional packages needed:
- sentence-transformers (for HuggingFaceEmbeddings)
- nltk (with required data downloads)
- protobuf==3.20.0 (to fix compatibility issues)

Run download_nltk_data.py first to ensure all required NLTK resources are available.
